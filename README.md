## About HackerRank

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a platform that provides competitive coding challenges, interview preparation, and coding contests for programmers to improve their skills and for companies to assess candidates.

## Challenges

The challenges are part of HackerRank's 3 Month Interview Preparation Kit. Below is a table listing the weeks, and each individual week has a README for the programming languages in which solutions are provided.
