![image](https://hrcdn.net/fcore/assets/work/header/hackerrank_logo-21e2867566.svg)

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges from HackerRank's 3 Month Interview Preparation Kit in C++, C, Python, Java, and Rust.

## About HackerRank

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a platform that provides competitive coding challenges, interview preparation, and coding contests for programmers to improve their skills and for companies to assess candidates.

## Challenges

The challenges are part of HackerRank's 3 Month Interview Preparation Kit. Below is a table listing the weeks, and each individual week has a README for the programming languages in which solutions are provided.

**PS 1:** I'm mostly efficient in CPP and Python, so most of the solutions solutions are for CPP and python. If you need a solution for any other languange please make an [Issue](https://github.com/arindal1/HackerRank-three-month-interview-prep/issues), I'll *try* to provide the solution. On the other hand if you have the solutions for other languages which I have not provided than feel free to make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/arindal1/HackerRank-three-month-interview-prep/pulls), and contribute. It'll be a great help. <br>
**PS 2:** Many of the functions might not pass all the test cases in the IDE, because I am not proficient in all the languages ([I'm only human afterall...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9D0Cw3B8ZE)). So, avoid copy-pasting the fuctions hoping them to run first try, understand the logic, make necessary adjustments and pray to god that it passes all the test cases. <br>
